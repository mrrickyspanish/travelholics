## 📊 Key Metrics to Track

Once live, monitor:
- **Form submission rate** (visits → submissions)
- **TikTok referral traffic** (should be primary source)
- **Mobile vs desktop usage** (expect 70%+ mobile from TikTok)
- **Time on page** (longer = more engaged)
- **Bounce rate** (lower = better UX)

Vercel provides basic analytics, or add Google Analytics for deeper insights.

- ✅ Site loads fast (<3 seconds)
