# Travelholics Landing Page Audit & Best Practices Review

## 1. Initial Repo Audit
The current repository (`mrrickyspanish/travelholics`) is a fresh Next.js 15 project using the default boilerplate.
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Status**: Empty scaffold. No custom components, branding, or lead forms are currently present in the `main` branch.

## 2. Travel Advisor Landing Page Best Practices
Based on industry research for cruise specialists and travel advisors, the landing page should include the following core elements:

### Authority Positioning (Yolanda's Profile)
- **Professional Bio**: Must highlight her "Certified Cruise Specialist" status and years of experience.
- **Visuals**: A professional, friendly headshot (positioned as the "face" of the brand).
- **Specialization**: Clear focus on Cruising as the primary offering, with secondary vacations mentioned to build breadth.

### Lead Capture & Conversion
- **High-Intent Forms**: Instead of a generic "Contact Us," use a "Start Planning Your Cruise" form.
- **Form Fields**: Collect specific data (Destination, Budget, Dates, Number of Travelers) to pre-qualify leads.
- **CTAs**: Clear, action-oriented buttons (e.g., "Book a Consultation," "Get My Custom Itinerary").

### Content & Social Proof
- **TikTok Integration**: Since Yolanda has a growing TikTok fan base, including a social feed or video testimonials would leverage her existing authority.
- **Certifications**: Display CLIA or other cruise-specific badges to build instant trust.

## 3. Positioning Strategy
- **Niche**: "The Cruise Expert." Don't try to be a generalist. Lead with cruises to attract the TikTok audience.
- **Value Prop**: Personal touch, expert navigation of complex cruise options, and "insider" knowledge.

## 4. Next Steps for Ricky
- [ ] Provide the remaining files (branding, images, custom components).
- [ ] Define the specific lead capture fields needed for Yolanda's workflow.
- [ ] Confirm if Supabase or a third-party form tool (like Typeform or Resend) will be used for lead management.
